​This repository operates as the central digital nervous system for the 45th Batch Graduation Festival. We are architecting a zero-cost, high-impact digital legacy that outlives the event itself.
​Objective: To capture the ephemeral joy of "Rag Day" into a permanent digital archive.
​Methodology: Headless architecture for rapid asset deployment on low-spec hardware.

​Target: 100% Alumni coverage in the directory.
